# About Me

My goal is to learn how to create software that will help people and improve the world. I often come up with cool ideas, but I don't have enough knowledge and experience to create it.
I am 24 years old. At the age of 16, I got my first job as a loader. In the 2nd year of university, I worked at McDonald's. After that, I got a job as a Junior QA at a startup in California. I have been working for the state Forest Protection for the last two years.

**My strengths:**
* Hard work
* I quickly learn new things
* Critical thinking
* Spatial thinking
* The ability to clarify difficult things in simple words
